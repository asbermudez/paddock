/**
 * Live status in the browser tab (#958 part 3): a title prefix and a coloured
 * dot on the favicon, so a tab says "working" or "something landed" without
 * being looked at.
 *
 * | Page          | Running (orange dot, `● `)   | Unread (green dot)                        |
 * |---------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
 * | Chat page     | this chat's turn in flight   | `✓ ` this chat is unread while you're on  |
 * |               |                              | it in a background tab                    |
 * | Project pages | any chat in the project      | `(n) ` replies landed while tab hidden    |
 * | Root `/`      | anything on the instance     | `(n) ` same, instance-wide                |
 *
 * Running wins the dot; the title carries both (`● (2) hushpod — House`).
 *
 * Project/root `(n)` is "NEW since you last looked at THIS tab", not the unread
 * backlog. Backlog never expires, so counting it would leave the root tab
 * permanently `(n)` + green on any real instance — noise, not signal. Only a
 * reply that landed after the tab was last visible counts: nothing counts while
 * the tab IS visible (the sidebar and fleet strip are right there), and a tab
 * loaded hidden starts its baseline at load. The sidebar and fleet-strip counts
 * are untouched — they still show the whole backlog.
 *
 * The data lives in two places, so the plumbing is a round trip through one
 * context, provided by `AppShell`:
 *  - the ROUTE knows what the tab is about (a {@link TabScope}) and, for a chat,
 *    whether its reply is unseen — it publishes that with {@link usePublishTabScope};
 *  - the SHELL knows the running set, the unread list and the tab's visibility
 *    baseline, so it resolves
 *    the scope into a {@link TabStatus}, draws the favicon from it, and hands it
 *    back down through the same context for the route's title prefix.
 * A route that publishes nothing (Discover, Config, the grid) shows no status.
 * Outside an `AppShell` (component tests) the context is inert: idle, no-op.
