/**
 * Unread affordance (#160), extracted from ProjectView.tsx (issue #403). A chat
 * is unread when the agent finished a turn while the user wasn't viewing it, or
 * the user MANUALLY flagged it unread (#458). Three signals combine:
 *  - `c.unread`: the per-user manual "mark unread" override (#458), server-backed;
 *  - `liveUnread`: chats flagged the instant a turn completed for a NON-focused
 *    chat this session (from the shared socket's running-set transitions);
 *  - server `lastTurnCompletedAt` newer than the server-backed last-seen time
 *    (`lib/lastSeen.ts`), which covers reload + turns that finished while away.
 * Marking a chat seen (open/focus, or its turn completing while focused) bumps
 * lastSeen=now, clears its live flag, and clears the manual override (via the
 * `onSeen` callback + the server's `/seen` route). `seenVersion` bumps on every
 * mark so the derivation recomputes. The one exception is an INFERRED seen
 * (#608) — a turn landing in the chat you happen to be looking at — which bumps
 * lastSeen but leaves an explicit "mark unread" alone: intent beats inference.
 *
 * Owns `liveUnread`/`seenVersion` internally; the WS-owned `runningSessions` set
 * stays owned by ProjectView and is passed in (the fleet-wide running set must
 * not fragment). Returns `markSeen` (also called by the sidebar), its
 * whole-subtree sibling `markManySeen` (#508), and the derived `unread` set.
 * `onSeen` MUST be stable (a `useCallback`) — markSeen depends on it, and the
 * auto-mark-seen effect depends on markSeen.
 *
 * Seen only while visible (#958): the two AUTOMATIC marks — opening the chat,
 * and its turn landing while it is open — are deferred while the tab is hidden
 * (a background tab, a middle-clicked "open in new tab"), and performed on the
 * next `visibilitychange` to visible IF the chat is still the focused one. While
 * deferred, the focused chat is allowed to be unread like any other, so the tab's
 * status, the sidebar and the fleet strip all say "a reply landed you haven't
 * seen". Explicit marks (a click) are not deferred; a click implies visibility.
